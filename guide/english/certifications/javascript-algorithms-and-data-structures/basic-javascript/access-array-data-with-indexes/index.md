## Access Array Data with Indexes

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
The first element of an array is at position zero. So, if you want to access the first element of an array, you can do it like so:

```javascript
var arr = ["Programming", 123, "Coding", 789];

var firstElem = arr[0] // This is "Programming"
var thirdElem = arr[2] // This is "Coding"
var fourthElem = arr[3] // This is 789
```

Notice that the length of the array is 4, and the position of the last element of the array is 3.


My Changes.
<h1> Access array elements with Indices<h1>
 <p><b>Array</b> is a special Data Structure that store <span>Ordered Collection</span>. 
  Array elements are numbered, starting with zero.
  We can get an element by its number in square brackets</p>
 <h4>Consider this array</h4>
 ```javascript
 ` var Arr=["Fahad",true,3,null] `
 ```
  <p>First position of <span>array element is 0</span> not 1.
 In order to access an element from an array we just have to put the array name followed by the index of it within a square bracket </p>.
 <span> just Like this</span>
 ```javascript
 ` var element1=Arr[1];//this will output true`
  ```
